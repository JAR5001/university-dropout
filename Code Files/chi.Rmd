# Chi - Squared

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dplyr)

df_chi <- data %>%
          select(c(course, displaced, educational_special_needs, debtor, gender, scholarship_holder, same_sex_parent_education, opposite_sex_parent_profession, previous_education, single, international, dropout))

matrix <- data.matrix(df_chi) # turn data into matrix
cols <- asplit(matrix, 2) # split matrix into columns

# Apply the chi test to the table of every pair of columns in the matrix.
# sim = TRUE clears errors 'approximation' messages.
# $p.value gets the score for each one.

chis <- outer(cols, cols, Vectorize(function(x,y) chisq.test(table(x,y), sim = TRUE)$p.value))

heatmap(chis, scale = "column", Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, margins = c(12,3), main = "Heatmap of P Values", col = brewer.pal(8, "Oranges"))

# With p-values, we actually want lower scores, so we're looking for the white bits

# Confirms no relationship between International/Education Special Needs and Dropout

drop_scores <- chis[-c(3,11),12]

barplot(drop_scores)

#All the rest are the same.
